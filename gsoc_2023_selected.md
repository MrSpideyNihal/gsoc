### Add functional MRI support to InVesalius

InVesalius currently does not support the simultaneous visualization of functional and structural MRI. This task will expand the support to processed functional MRI.

**Requirements**: Computer with Windows, Linux or Mac OS installed. A source code editor, Python language and InVesalius libraries dependencies. 

**Deliverables**:
- User interface to support and control fMRI parameters
- Visualization features for fMRI

**Programming Languages**: Python

**Duration**: 350h

### Add PACS communication

InVesalius currently does not support loading DICOM images from a PACS server. The idea is to have a way to search for images in a PACS, download the images and load the images.

**Requirements**: Computer with Windows, Linux or Mac OS installed. A source code editor, Python language and InVesalius libraries dependencies. A PACS server like [Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/) or [DCM4CHE](https://www.dcm4che.org/).

**Deliverables**:
- Tool to communicate with PACS server
- Save the surfaces and masks in the PACS

**Programming Languages**: Python

**Duration**: 350h
